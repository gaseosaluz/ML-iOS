Code here is from the book "Machine Learning with CoreML" (https://smile.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Core-developers-implementing-ebook/dp/B07DH9TXV2/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=machine+learning+with+core+ML&qid=1568751386&s=gateway&sr=8-3). The book has a repo, howeer the code here is code that I typed in as I worked through the book. It has also been updated as needed to run With Swift 5 and Xcode 10.
